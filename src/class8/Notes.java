//Loops help us repeat instruction in code for example if we have to print the number from 1 to 100 one way we can do
//this is by copying and pasting the code which is bad and not scalable other way of doing this is using loops.

//                There are 4 types of loops:
//       1.While
//       2. do while
//       3. for loop
//       4. enhanced for loop
//                          break keyword:
 //        break keyword is used to stop a loop just the condition that we use inside a loop.
 //                         Continue:
//         Is used to skip all the code written inside the body of the loop.
//         We should always use break and continue with if conditions.
