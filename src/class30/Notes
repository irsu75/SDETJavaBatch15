             Set:

Sets do not allow duplicate values. There are three main types of sets 1)HashSet
                                                                       2)LinkedHashSet
                                                                       3)TreeSet

            HashSet:

Upside: Speed it's the fastest
Downside: It does not maintain the insertion order

           LinkedHashSet:

Upside: Maintains the insertion order
Downside: Slower than HasSet

          TreeSet:

Upside: Keeps the data sorted
Downside: It's slower than all.

          Map:
Maps allow us to store data in the form of key value pairs. Just like Sets we have three main types of maps as well
   1) HashMap      2) LinkedHashMap      3) TreeMap

          HashMap(most widely used):

Upside: Speed it's the fastest
Downside: It does not maintain the insertion order

           LinkedHashMap:

Upside: Maintains the insertion order
Downside: Slower than HasSet

          TreeMap:

Upside: Keeps the data sorted
Downside: It's slower than all.
