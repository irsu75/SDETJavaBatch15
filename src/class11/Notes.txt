                       OOP (Object oriented programming)
        It's just a way of writing code. That follows certain rules or guidelines. We create that have
        attributes/properties/fields and methods/function/behaviourism.
                       Why we should we learn OOP?
        1. it simplifies the software  development and maintenance (adding new features changing the existing code).
        2. Code duplication is reduced.
        3. It also helps us represent something from real life with the help of class and object.
                        Class:
        is a blueprint or a design from which actual real life objects   are created. Computer uses a class to check
        what that class can do Scanner scan=new Scanner(System.in). Here Scanner ->is class. Scan -> object of scanner
        class.
                        Object:
        Objects are created from classes, and we can use them to call methods and the properties from those class.
                        Note:
       Inside a class sequence does not matter you can define the methods first or the properties first .
       But when we are inside a method then sequence matters.
