                 Overriding- process when same method exist in super and subclass

                 Why -to provide flexibility

                 How to implement:
        1. Inheritance
        2. same signature ( name+parameters)
        3. same return type
        4. access modifiers -> overriding method must have same level of visibility or higher

      final - keyword identifies something is completed and modification can be done

               final can be used with:

      variables - makes variable CONSTANT
      methods - cannot override it
      class - cannot be inherited

      Abstraction - process of hiding implementation details and showing only functionality
      Why - reduce complexity, improve maintainability and security

         How to implement abstraction?
 By using Abstract classes - we can achieve 0 to 100% abstraction
 By using Interfaces
