         Method- overriding:

   Method - overriding happens when same method with different implementation exists in parent and child class .

        Why should we override a method:

   1) Flexibility.
   when we inherit from a class and if we don't like some methods we can modify them.

        Rules:

   1) private methods and constructor can't be overridden because they don't participate in inheritance.
   2) if we want to override something we must recreate that exact method inside the child class and can have
      a different implementations only access modifier can be different. It can have more visibility then the method
      inside the parent class.

         Note:
   1) Right click in editor inside your class and click on generate -> select the fields that you want in your
      constructor and click on done
   2) If we press ctrl+o we get an option to override the available methods.
