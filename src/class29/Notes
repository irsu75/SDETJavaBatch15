         Iterator:

 Sets like HashSet, LinkedHasSet and TreeSet allow duplicate value. There are three main types of Sets.

 HashSet:

 Upside:Fast
 Downside : Does not retain the insertion order

 LinkedHashset:

 Upside: Retains the insertion order.
 Downside: it's slower than HashSet

 TreeSet:

 Upside: it keeps the data sorted
 Downside: it's the slowest.
