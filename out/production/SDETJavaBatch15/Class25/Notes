      Abstraction:

Allows us to simply code by hiding implementation details and only showing the functionality to the user.
in Java we can achieve this in two ways 1) Abstract classes 2) interface

     Interface

Is very similar to a abstract class. We can have private methods, static methods default methods abstract
method we can be static  in a interface. We can't have instance fields in a interface and because
we don't have instance fields we also can't have a constructor in a interface.

    When we should use interface:

When objects are closely related to each other and there is a "Is a" relationship between classes then we should go
with abstract classes if we want to use abstraction. If Objects are not related to each other then we should
implement abstraction with the help of interfaces.
