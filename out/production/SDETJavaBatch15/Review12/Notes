Exception:

    Exception is an unwanted behavior that occurs at runtime, and it terminates the program abruptly

There are three main types of issues in java programs:
   1) Syntax error    2) Logical error  3) Exception(runtime error)

1) Syntax error:

Syntax error occur when we do not follow the java syntax for example:
when we have to create a variable we must define its data type or use the var keyword if we don't do this we will
get a syntax error. Syntax errors occur a time of writing code. They do not allow us to compile the code.
How to solve: use your IDEs to find and fix these issues
2) Logical errors:

Logical error occur when the programs don't do things that are supposed to do.
For example: You write some code to click on a button but your program instead clicks on a checkbox or on some other
button. You write code to print numbers from 0 to 10, but program only prints 0 to 9.

3) Exception (runtime error)
Are the errors which are produced at runtime. Here code compiles fine but the moment you try to run your program
it throws errors.

How to fix: Read the error and take the help from the class whose exception is being thrown for example
NullPointerException.

Exception Handling:

   Exception handling is finding and fixing runtime errors and coming up with ways to avoid these errors.

There are some keywords and blocks of code that we can use to avoid these exception.
1) we have   1)try  2)catch  3)finally  4)throws 5)throw

try - catch block:

helps us test the code by putting it inside the try block and if something goes wrong java executes the associated
catch block where we can put backup code, or we can notify the admins.
