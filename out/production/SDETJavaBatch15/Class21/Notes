       Super keyword:

Is used to refer to the parent class members like fields methods and constructors.
       When we should use Super or "this" keyword:
when ever same name field or method exists inside the parent and child class. We can use
explicitly refer to parent class variables methods or constructors.
      NOTE:
By default java prefers local variables than instance variables from the same class after the instance variables or
methods from the parent class.

     Method overloading.
Method overloading happens when same name method exists n a class with different parameters. We can overload
methods in 3 different ways.
1) By changing the number of parameters.
2) By changing the data types.
3) By changing the sequence of parameters.
     Why should we overload a method or constructor?
    Clean code and flexibility to the end user.
Some important:
 - if else conditions
 - loops
 - array
 - methods
 - String class methods
 inheritance
